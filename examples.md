# Examples and Tutorials

Here you will find a list of examples and tutorials on how to use the ubirch system.

## Before you start

Head over to the [Ubirch Console](https://console.demo.ubirch.com) and [register](console#register-and-login) yourself to get access to the backend services. While you could start sending data directly between two devices and do the verification by hand, using the ubirch backend brings you an intermediate step that verifies the signatures, handles the identities (public keys), and provides streaming and blockchain services for verified data.

You will need to register to receive an authorization token for using the [Ubirch Trust Service API](api).
